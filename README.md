# What is this?
This is a tiny repo that holds some of my custom Visual Studio Code settings, keybinds, snippets, etc.

# Why?
So I stop losing track of them.

# How do I use these?

## Snippets
Here's how you can create your own snippets:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets

Wherever it says the snippet files go, that's where you should put my `*.code-snippets` files.

My snippets went in `C:\Users\[MYACCT]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets`

## Keybindings
To add custom keybindings, use the command panel in VS Code (ctrl+shift+p) and type/choose `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts JSON`.

You can then copy/paste the keybindings from my JSON into your JSON. You can change the keybindings if you prefer or use them as-is.

# Wow, cool!
I know, right?
